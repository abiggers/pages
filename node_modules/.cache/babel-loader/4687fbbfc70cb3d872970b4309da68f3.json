You will need to make sure that you have the following packages installed: 3d-force-graph, d3-force-3d, three, d3-scale-chromatic, d3-scale. The easiest way to do this is to open a terminal in the package installation directory and run the 'npm install' command. This will ensure all packages required are installed with the correct version. for example:</p>\n                        <p>*Assuming my components folder was located at <b>biggers-software/src/components/</b>*<br /> I would open a terminal and run the following commands:</p>\n                        <p style={{ backgroundColor: 'gray', width: '50%', marginLeft: '25%' }}><b>cd biggers-software/src/components<br />git clone https://github.com/abiggers/d3Manipulator.git<br />cd d3Manipulator<br />npm install</b></p>\n                        <p>And that is it! your component is ready to be embedded in your existing React application!</p>\n                        <h3>Using the Component</h3>\n                        <p>To use the component on your React website, just add <text style={{ color: 'blue' }}><b>import D3Manipulator from '/your/installation/directory/d3Manipulator</b></text> to the top of the page, and then place the component like so: <text style={{ color: 'blue' }}><b>{\"<D3Manipulator title={*pass in graph title here*} data={*pass in graph data here*} />\"}</b></text></p>\n                        <p> All of the settings that you are able to toggle from the user's point of view are pretty self explanitory, just be aware that if you are changing the color by option or the color scale option, there will be a slight delay before you see the change, as the application is remapping the color scale based on the newly provided specifications.</p>\n                        <p>And that's pretty much it! have fun playing with the D3 Manipulator and check back soon for expanded functionality!</p>\n                        \n                    </div>} />\n                  \n            </div>\n    \n        )\n\n\n\n    }\n}\n\n\n//exports our component\nexport default Code"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
